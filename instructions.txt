How to use Shell (patriotsh>)

To run shell with our tester file (input.txt)
1. Make --> creates "test" executable in src directory 
2. "tests/output.txt" is created within the Makefile 
3. All test cases are in "tests/input.txt" file 
4. Compares "tests/output.txt" with "tests/expectedOut.txt"
All correct if terminal says: 
"Files tests/output.txt and tests/expectedOutput.txt are identical"
